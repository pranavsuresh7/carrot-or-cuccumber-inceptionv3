# carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3
This is a small task of my mini project!! Differentiated carrot and cuccumber by using some google images. 
I have used transfer learning based on # inceptionv3 model for getting higher accuracy.
Used this documentation https://keras.io/applications/#inceptionv3 for doing this image recognition.
Some images I collected from google image as datasets- cuccumber https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3/tree/master/cuccumber ,carrot -https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3/tree/master/dataset
