# carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3
This is my repo for help in sorting  vegetables for farmers with some standard scale,so they can supply to market.
This is a only a small task of my mini project!! Differentiated carrot and cuccumber by using some google images. 
I have used transfer learning based on # inceptionv3 model for getting higher accuracy.
Used this documentation https://keras.io/applications/#inceptionv3 for doing this image recognition.
Some images I collected from google image as datasets- cuccumber https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3/tree/master/cuccumber ,carrot -https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3/tree/master/dataset
I have made the model and saved to a h5 file which you can run https://github.com/pranavsuresh7/carrot-or-cuccumber-inceptionv3/blob/master/differentiator.h5.
Also for live image processing I have used cv2 for image capturing and predicted it with this model.
